# Hair type prediction cnn model

## Description

This repository contains a machine learning model for predicting hair types. It includes the necessary scripts, datasets, and documentation to train, evaluate, and deploy the model. The project primarily focuses on the showcasing the use of regularisation techniques. At the moment it cannot be used in production as there's more to add to this project

## How to Run

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ML-model-hairType-prediction.git
    cd ML-model-hairType-prediction
    ```

2. **Install the required dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Prepare the dataset:**
    Ensure you have the dataset in the correct directory or download it using the provided script:

4. **Run the notebook**
    To run the notebook navigate to the rood directory and open the notebook.ipynb file and click run all to run all cells

## Alternatively
You can also use the model in normal python files but importing the pickle library and loading the models
